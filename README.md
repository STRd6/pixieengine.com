Install postgresql if you don't have it

- `brew install postgresql`
- `brew services start postgresql`

Install ImageMagick so that you can install RMagick.
If you're on OSX Sierra, you'll need to force an older version of ImageMagick

- `brew install imagemagick@6`
- `brew link --force imagemagick@6`

Install all the project's dependencies with `bundle install`

## Ubuntu Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev imagemagick libmagickwand-dev postgresql libpq-dev
```

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```

## First time configuration

Create your development database

`bundle exec rake db:setup`

## Syncing your local db with prod

1. Install the Heroku CLI
2. Log in to the CLI
3. Make sure you have added the heroku remote for this project
4. Run script/sync-db-with-prod
