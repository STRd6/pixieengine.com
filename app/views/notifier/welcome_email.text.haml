  Greetings #{@user.display_name}, and welcome to Pixie!

  On Pixie you'll create amazing games from anywhere with an internet connection and be able to instantly share them with the world.

  How about giving it a try right now? We have an entire section of tutorials: #{projects_url(@link_tracking.merge({:filter => 'tutorials'}))}. There's even a showcase of complete games you can play, explore, and learn from: #{projects_url(@link_tracking.merge({:filter => 'featured'}))}.

  You can also dig in to our vast gallery of pixel art: #{sprites_url(@link_tracking)}, as well as create your own: #{new_sprite_url(@link_tracking)}.

  As the community grows our aim is to provide everyone the creative means to produce games: ideas, tools, and data. The more that we offer, the more that's returned to the community by way of new ideas and new creations.

  Veritably Yours,
  Pixie
